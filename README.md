# project
Basically , we integrate docker with jenkins,git bash
In this, we have two environments testing and production. Both environments are identical coz we lauch this from docker image httpd.
Used Jenkins for pulling code from github and deployed on Docker where clients access the website,
and use the code deployed by developer and whole process is automated
